@article{McGreivy,
	abstract = {A new stellarator coil design code is introduced that optimizes the position and winding pack orientation of finite-build coils. The new code, called flexible optimized curves in space using automatic differentiation (AD) and finite build (FOCUSADD), performs gradient-based optimization in a high-dimensional, non-convex space. The derivatives with respect to parameters of finite-build coils are easily and efficiently computed using AD. FOCUSADD parametrizes coil positions in free space using a Fourier series and uses a multi-filament approximation to the coil winding pack. The orientation of the winding pack is parametrized with a Fourier series and can be optimized as well. Optimized finite-build coils for a Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)-like stellarator are found, and compared with filamentary coil results. The final positions of optimized finite-build W7-X-like coils are shifted, on average, by approximately 2.5 mm relative to optimized filamentary coils. These results suggest that finite-build effects should be accounted for in the optimization of stellarators with low coil tolerances.},

@article{Reynolds,
	abstract = {Single-fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is a fluid description of fusion plasmas which is often used to investigate macroscopic instabilities in tokamaks. In MHD modeling of tokamaks, it is often desirable to compute MHD phenomena to resistive time scales or a combination of resistive-Alfv{\'e}n time scales, which can render explicit time stepping schemes computationally expensive. We present recent advancements in the development of preconditioners for fully nonlinearly implicit simulations of single-fluid resistive tokamak MHD. Our work focuses on simulations using a structured mesh mapped into a toroidal geometry with a shaped poloidal cross-section, and a finite-volume spatial discretization of the partial differential equation model. We discretize the temporal dimension using a fully implicit θ or the backwards differentiation formula method, and solve the resulting nonlinear algebraic system using a standard inexact Newton--Krylov approach, provided by the sundials library. The focus of this paper is on the construction and performance of various preconditioning approaches for accelerating the convergence of the iterative solver algorithms. Effective preconditioners require information about the Jacobian entries; however, analytical formulae for these Jacobian entries may be prohibitive to derive/implement without error. We therefore compute these entries using automatic differentiation with OpenAD. We then investigate a variety of preconditioning formulations inspired by standard solution approaches in modern MHD codes, in order to investigate their utility in a preconditioning context. We first describe the code modifications necessary for the use of the OpenAD tool and sundials solver library. We conclude with numerical results for each of our preconditioning approaches in the context of pellet-injection fueling of tokamak plasmas. Of these, our optimal approach results in a speedup of a factor of 3 compared with non-preconditioned implicit tests, with that performance gap rapidly widening with increasing mesh refinement.},

The operation of the diagnostic has been extended to allow simultaneously measurement of the pedestal temperature profile at the inboard and outboard midplane with high spatial and temporal resolution. Access to the inboard midplane region is obtained by measuring ordinary mode electron cyclotron emission (ECE) (no harmonic overlap) using an antenna located on the low-field side of the torus. To assess the potential of the ECE temperature measurements in the inboard pedestal region, a detailed analysis of ECE spectrum will be discussed. The measured electron temperature profiles are presented, including a discussion of the main uncertainties in the analysis. The comparison of inboard and outboard temperature pedestal profiles in a variety of H-mode plasmas shows a reasonable agreement in both shape and magnitude.},

A simple suitable approximation of the Landau--Lifshitz equation for the RR force and a novel leap-frog pusher for its inclusion in particle-in-cell simulations are provided. Simulations for both linear and circular polarization of the laser pulse are performed and compared. It is found that at intensities exceeding 1023 W cm− 2 the RR force strongly affects the dynamics for a linearly polarized laser pulse, reducing the maximum ion energy but also the width of the spectrum. In contrast, no significant effect is found for circularly polarized laser pulses whenever the laser pulse does not break through the foil.},

@article{Carbajal,
	abstract = { The dynamics of RE (runaway electrons) in fusion plasmas span a wide range of temporal scales, from the fast gyro-motion,    ∼   10   − 11     s, to the observational time scales,    ∼   10   − 2   → 1   s. To cope with this scale separation, RE are usually studied within the bounce-average or the guiding center approximations. Although these approximations have yielded valuable insights, a study with predictive capabilities of RE in fusion plasmas calls for the incorporation of full orbit effects in configuration space in the presence of three-dimensional magnetic fields. We present numerical results on this problem using the Kinetic Orbit Runaway electrons Code that follows relativistic electrons in general electric and magnetic fields under the full Lorentz force, collisions, and radiation losses. At relativistic energies, the main energy loss is due to radiation damping, which we incorporate using the Landau-Lifshitz formulation of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force. The main focus is on full orbit effects on synchrotron radiation. It is shown that even in the absence of magnetic field stochasticty, neglecting orbit dynamics can introduce significant errors in the computation of the total radiated power and the synchrotron spectra. The statistics of collisionless (i.e., full orbit induced) pitch angle dispersion, and its key role played on synchrotron radiation, are studied in detail. Numerical results are also presented on the pitch angle dependence of the spatial confinement of RE and on full orbit effects on the competition of electric field acceleration and radiation damping. Finally, full orbit calculations are used to explore the limitations of gyro-averaging in the relativistic regime. To explore the practical impact of the results, DIII-D and ITER-like parameters are used in the simulations. },

The majority of simulations also exhibit an increase in the RE beam energy due to acceleration by the induced toroidal electric field, even while the RE beam current is decreasing. In this study, KORC integrates RE orbits using the relativistic guiding center equations of motion and incorporates time-sequenced, experimental reconstructions of the magnetic and electric fields and line integrated electron density to construct spatiotemporal models of electron and partially ionized impurity transport in the companion plasma. Comparisons of experimental current evolution and KORC results demonstrate the importance of including Coulomb collisions with partially ionized impurity physics, initial RE energy, pitch angle, and spatial distributions, and spatiotemporal electron and partially ionized impurity transport. This research provides an initial quantification of the efficacy of RE mitigation via injected impurities and identification of the critical role played by loss of confinement due to plasma scrape off on the inner wall as compared to the relatively slow collisional damping.},

@article{Hoppe,
	abstract = {Avoidance of the harmful effects of runaway electrons (REs) in plasma-terminating disruptions is pivotal in the design of safety systems for magnetic fusion devices. Here, we describe a computationally efficient numerical tool, that allows for self-consistent simulations of plasma cooling and associated RE dynamics during disruptions. It solves flux-surface averaged transport equations for the plasma density, temperature and poloidal flux, using a bounce-averaged kinetic equation to self-consistently provide the electron current, heat, density and RE evolution, as well as the electron distribution function. As an example, we consider disruption scenarios with material injection and compare the electron dynamics resolved with different levels of complexity, from fully kinetic to fluid modes.

The runaway electrons can be simulated either as a fluid, fully kinetically, or as a mix of the two. Plasma temperature, current density, electric field, ion density and charge states are all evolved self-consistently, where kinetic non-thermal contributions are captured using an orbit-averaged relativistic electron Fokker-Planck equation, which couples to the plasma evolution. In the typical use case, the electrons are represented by two distinct populations: a cold fluid population and a kinetic superthermal population. Solution method: The system of equations is solved using a standard multidimensional Newton's method. Partial differential equations---most prominently the bounce-averaged Fokker--Planck and current diffusion equations---are discretized using a high-resolution finite volume scheme that preserves density and positivity.},

@article{deGrassie,
	abstract = {The intrinsic toroidal velocity, Vϕ, in DIII-D (Luxon 2002 Nucl. Fusion 42 614) H-modes is measured to be nonzero in the pedestal region, in the direction of the plasma current, co-Ip. Intrinsic, or spontaneous, velocity is that which arises with no known external momentum injection. This intrinsic velocity is measured to scale roughly linearly with the local ion temperature, Ti, Vϕ ∼ Ti, in the pedestal and in the edge region just inside the pedestal. With either co-Ip, or counter-Ip neutral beam injected torque, the pedestal velocity is accelerated in the direction of the torque; it is not a fixed boundary condition. A simple model of thermal ion orbit loss predicts the sign of Vϕ, a relevant magnitude for Vϕ, and the approximate scaling Vϕ ∼ Ti. This model for a boundary condition on the intrinsic toroidal velocity gives a result of approximate diamagnetic form, Vϕ ∼ εpTi/LBθ, where L is a scale length, Bθ the poloidal magnetic field and εp a small numerical parameter. This model is a local calculation of velocity, an approximation to the inherently nonlocal region of the pedestal where the thermal ion banana width is comparable to the pedestal width. In this model we also assume that the loss cone in velocity space is empty; no collisions are considered. A recent particle simulation of the pedestal region of a DIII-D NBI-driven H-mode discharge that includes collisions indicates that thermal ion orbit loss results in a co-Ip velocity just inside the last closed flux surface (Chang and Ku 2008 Phys. Plasmas 15 062510-1). Thus, we do not expect that nonlocality nor finite collisionality wash out the effect. Inside the pedestal our model shows that thermal ion orbit loss is negligible. In this region of the edge we also measure a similar scaling for the intrinsic velocity several pedestal widths inside the pedestal location, Vϕ ∼ Ti.

    abstract = {Radiation reaction (RR) effects on the acceleration of a thin plasma foil by a superintense laser pulse in the radiation pressure-dominated regime are investigated theoretically. A simple suitable approximation of the Landau–Lifshitz equation for the RR force and a novel leap-frog pusher for its inclusion in particle-in-cell simulations are provided. Simulations for both linear and circular polarization of the laser pulse are performed and compared. It is found that at intensities exceeding 1023 W cm− 2 the RR force strongly affects the dynamics for a linearly polarized laser pulse, reducing the maximum ion energy but also the width of the spectrum. In contrast, no significant effect is found for circularly polarized laser pulses whenever the laser pulse does not break through the foil.}}

    abstract = {PROCESS is a reactor systems code – it assesses the engineering and economic viability of a hypothetical fusion power station using simple models of all parts of a reactor system, from the basic plasma physics to the generation of electricity. It has been used for many years, but details of its operation have not been previously published. This paper describes some of its capabilities. PROCESS is usually used in optimisation mode, in which it finds a set of parameters that maximise (or minimise) a figure of merit chosen by the user, while being consistent with the inputs and the specified constraints. Because the user can apply all the physically relevant constraints, while allowing a large number of parameters to vary, it is in principle only necessary to run the code once to produce a self-consistent, physically plausible reactor model. The scope of PROCESS is very wide and goes well beyond reactor physics, including conversion of heat to electricity, buildings, and costs, but this paper describes only the plasma physics and magnetic field calculations. The capabilities of PROCESS in plasma physics are limited, as its main aim is to combine engineering, physics and economics. A model is described which shows the main plasma features of an inductive ITER scenario. Significant differences between the PROCESS results and the published scenario include the bootstrap current and loop voltage. The PROCESS models for these are being revised. Two new models for DEMO have been obtained. The first, DEMO A, is intended to be “conservative” in that it might be possible to build it using the technology of the near future. For example, since current drive technologies are not yet mature, only 12% of the current is assumed to be due to current drive. Consequently it is a pulsed machine, able to burn for only 1.65hours at a time. Despite the comparatively large size (major radius is 9m), the fusion power is only 1.95GW. The assumed gross thermal efficiency is 33%, giving just 465MW net electric power. The second, DEMO B, is intended to be “advanced” in that more optimistic assumptions are made. Comparison of DEMO A and B with a reference ITER scenario shows that current drive and bootstrap fraction need the most extrapolation from the perspective of plasma physics.}}

    abstract = {PROCESS is a reactor systems code – it assesses the engineering and economic viability of a hypothetical fusion power station using simple models of all parts of a reactor system. PROCESS allows the user to choose which constraints to impose and which to ignore, so when evaluating the results it is vital to study the list of constraints used. New algorithms submitted by collaborators can be incorporated – for example safety, first wall erosion, and fatigue life will be crucial and are not yet taken into account. This paper describes algorithms relating to the engineering aspects of the plant. The toroidal field (TF) coils and the central solenoid are assumed by default to be wound from niobium-tin superconductor with the same properties as the ITER conductors. The winding temperature and induced voltage during a quench provide a limit on the current density in the TF coils. Upper limits are placed on the stresses in the structural materials of the TF coil, using a simple two-layer model of the inboard leg of the coil. The thermal efficiency of the plant can be estimated using the maximum coolant temperature, and the capacity factor is derived from estimates of the planned and unplanned downtime, and the duty cycle if the reactor is pulsed. An example of a pulsed power plant is given. The need for a large central solenoid to induce most of the plasma current, and physics assumptions that are conservative compared to some other studies, result in a large machine, with a cryostat 36m in diameter. Multiple constraints, working together, restrict the parameter space of the optimised model. For example, even when the ratio of operating current to critical current in the TF coils is increased by a factor of five, the total coil cross-section decreases only a little, because of the need for copper stabiliser, insulation, and structural support. The result is that the plasma major radius hardly changes. It is these surprising results that justify the development of systems codes.}}
