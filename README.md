# Quick Start Guide

graph_framework Graph computation framework that supports auto differentiation.
It is designed to allow domain scientists to create cross platform GPU 
accelerated code.

## Documentation
[graph_framework-docs](https://ornl-fusion.github.io/graph_framework-docs) Documentation for the graph_framework.

## Obtaining the Code
To get started clone this repository using the command.
```
git clone https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/graph_framework.git
```

## Compiling the Code
For instructions to build the code consult the 
[build system](https://ornl-fusion.github.io/graph_framework-docs/build_system.html)
documentation. This framework uses a [cmake](https://cmake.org) based build 
system and requires the [NetCDF-C](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)
library.
