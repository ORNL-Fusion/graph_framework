 * @section introduction Introduction
 * The <a href="https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/graph_framework">graph_framework</a>
 * is a domain specific compiler for translating physics equations to optimized
 * code that runs on GPUs and CPUs. The domain specific aspect limits this to
 * classes of problems where the same physics is applied to an ensemble. Eamples
 * include RF Ray tracing, particle pushing, and field line following.
 *
 * @subsection purpose Purpose
 * The purpose of this framework is to enable domain scientists to write code
 * that can run on any GPU and interface them with legacy codes.
 *
 * This framework enables:
 * * Portability to Nvidia, AMD, and Apple GPUs and CPUs.
 * * Abstraction of the physics from the compute.
 * * Enable Auto Differentiation.
 * * Enable easy embedding in C, C++, and Fortran codes.

 * @section tools User guides for tools
 * @subsection rf_ray_tracing RF Ray tracing
 * This section covers user guides to run the RF Ray tracing code. To run this
 * code, a user selects an equilibrium, a wave distribution function, a solver
 * method, intial ray conditions, and a power obsorption model. To run an
 * example follow the instructions for the @ref xrays_commandline_example.
